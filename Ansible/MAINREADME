## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the Yaml Playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

Enter the playbook file. FOUND IN ANSIBLE DIRECTORY-LISTS OF PLAYBOOKS ARE LOCATED IN THAT DIRECTORY

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available and resiliant to breaks in connection, in addition to restricting user accesss to the network.
What aspect of security do load balancers protect? Authentication of User Access, Web Traffic Offloading, DDOS prevention

What is the advantage of a jump box?
A main advantage is in being a hardened and monitored device that spans security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. 

What does Filebeat watch for? 
Filebeat monitors the log files/locations that you specify,It also collects and logs events then sends them either to Elasticsearch indexing.

What does Metricbeat record?
Metricbeat takes the metrics and statistics that it collects and sends them to Elasticsearch or Logstash. Metricbeat helps you monitor your servers by collecting metrics from the system and services running on the server.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web1     | Server   | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web2     | Server   | 10.0.07    | Linux            |
|          |          |            |                  |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- Whitelisted IP addresses: My personal IP

Machines within the network can only be accessed by ssh via port 22.

Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? Via my DVWA containter
What was its IP address? 10.0.0.5/10.0.0.7

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | No                  | Personal IP via ssh  |
| V.Net    | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| Elk Serv | No                  | Personal IP          |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
  > Main advantage is installing the monitoring software accross mulitple networks from a single access point

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Installation of Docker on the jump box
- Download image; applied containers to both vms (Web1 & Web2)
- Created and configured the appropriate scripts to install Filebeat and Metric Beat (found in Ansible Directory)
- Changed ansible hosts file to include new ip
- Changed ansible config file to new user admin

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _ 10.0.0.5
  _ 10.0.0.7

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat & Metric Beat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://[your.VM.IP]:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

- Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:
- Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?
  > Inside the Ansible directory of my repository. There is a notepad file with the full scripts displayed for use.
- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine?
  > Ansible hosts file. Configure the webservers to the appropriate ones.
How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
  > http://[your.VM.IP]:5601/app/kibana
